**Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)** provides vendor-neutral protocols, patterns, and open source components that enable AI agents to participate in commerce through:

- **Verifiable AI identities** with integrated compliance controls
- **Secure, automated payment processing** across multiple payment rails
- **Auditable receipt verification**
- **Intelligent human oversight** for critical transactions

Built on open **W3C Web Standards**, ACK enables AI Agents to manage their own identities, operate their own accounts and wallets, access paid services through standardized paywalls, compensate humans for data contributions, and optimize costs across complex service chains.

The patterns support extensions for agent discovery, secure communication, micropayments, subscription management, refund management, outcome-based pricing, and cross-currency transactions, all while maintaining appropriate security, privacy, and compliance controls with humans in the loop.
